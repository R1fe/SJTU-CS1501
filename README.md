# SJTU-CS1501
mainly code answers of homework and tests 

Hi, I am a student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. As a stupid student who suffered from the endlessly difficult homework and tests in the class, I hope to save some people that have the same problem as me.


Don't hurry! Please see the __notes__ below. 

1. The answers is for the class called __Thinking and Methodology in Programming(C++)__ (course code: __CS1501__) teached by __Prof.Ren (Qingsheng Ren)__ in __Shanghai Jiao Tong University__.
2. The answers is __just for reference__! Please remember: __TO STUDY, NOT TO PLAGIARIZE__.
3. This repository is created in the term __2024-2025-1__, so it is common to have some differences in homework and tests.

__Wish you all success and get a satisfactory grade in this class!__Don't forget to __star__ this repository if you gain a lot from it.
